I am [Maximilian Konzack](https://komax.github.io/), a computer scientist who works as a postdoctoral researcher at iDiv. I am keen on many topics: I like programming and  research the best when it's put into code. My interests include:
 * visual analytics
 * programming
 * algorithm engineering
 * visualization
 * open source
 * movement ecology
 * text mining
 * biodiversity
 * programming languages
 * tinkering with Raspberry Pis and microcontrollers.
  
If you want to get in contact, please drop me an email.

Thank you for your time reading my posts.
